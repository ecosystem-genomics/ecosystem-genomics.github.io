I have since been employed as a vegetation management/monitoring technician at Point Reyes National Seashore Association where I have been involved in habitat restoration and plant community monitoring. Having spent the last four years restoring disrupted ecosystems, I am excited to pursue a master’s degree in Natural Resources from the School of Natural Resources and the Environment to better understand the impacts of plant invasion on above and below ground plant-microbe communities. I hope to produce research that improves current land management efforts. I have the honor of being co-advised by Drs. Elise Gornish and Albert Barberán.

              <p> <p>I received an Environmental Biology degree from Washington University in St Louis where I conducted a senior thesis on the role soil microbes play in mediating plant-pollinator interactions. Since graduating, I have worked primarily with Point Reyes National Seashore Association as a vegetation and restoration ecology intern. This fall I will be joining the University of Arizona’s Ecology and Evolutionary Biology PhD program where I will be co-advised by Judith Bronstein and Rachel Gallery. I plan to continue investigating the role that the belowground microbial community plays in shaping the ecology and evolution of aboveground mutualisms.</p>

              <p> <p>I am excited to be pursuing a PhD in the Entomology and Insect Sciences GIDP at the University of Arizona with Dr. Matzkin as my NRT advisor. I received my bachelor’s degree at Cal Poly SLO in agriculture and plant sciences with a minor in biology. I hope to improve agricultural pest management techniques and global food stability through insect science and genetics.</p>

              <p> <p>I am a native Tucsonan and I have a BS from the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at the University of Arizona. I am pursuing an MS in Environmental Science, advised by Albert Barberán in his Microbial Macroecology lab. My main research interest is in microbial ecology. I like to study the environment on a micro scale in order to apply it to larger ecosystem studies. I am currently looking at the distribution and dispersal of microbes in relation to biogeography.</p>

              <p> <p>I graduated with a  BS in Microbiology and minor in Biochemistry from the University of Arizona Honors College in May. Beginning in Fall 2021, I will be pursuing a PhD in Environmental Science. My BRIDGES NRT program co-advisors will be Dr. Malak Tfaily and Dr. Jana U’Ren. My primary research interest is in the intersection between endophytic fungi and the chemical environment of their hosts. I aim to use genomics and molecular biology to identify the genetic basis for microbial functional traits and then use this knowledge to better understand patterns of microbial community assembly, biodiversity, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem function.</p>

I completed a BS in Biochemistry at the University of New Mexico where I did a senior research project on the impact of uranium mining legacy on root-associated fungal communities of the native grass Bouteloua gracilis. At the University of Arizona, I am pursuing a Master’s in Environmental Science under the mentorship of Dr. Betsy Arnold and Dr. Malak Tfaily. I am interested in how fungi participate in the cycling of nutrients in an ecosystem and how these interactions shape the environment.</p>
