    Each summer our NRT community comes together for a summit meeting that is equal parts science, training, inclusion, professional development, and science communication. Students pitch ideas and receive supportive feedback. Returning students describe their team-based experiences on internships. This is the flagship event of our program in which we grow and celebrate our diversity and scientific endeavors.
