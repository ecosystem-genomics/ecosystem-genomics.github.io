            Ecosystem genomics promises new knowledge to sustain the biological systems that support, interact with, and are disrupted by human society, such as the agroecosystems that supply food to the world -- and, more generally, the plants, microbes, and insects that shape local, regional, and global cycles of energy, water, and carbon in both natural and managed ecosystems. 
         </p>
         <p>
            BRIDGES is catalyzing the training of a new generation of diverse graduate students in UAâ€™s ecosystem genomics initiative, which brings together studies of genomes and ecosystems, through the lenses of plants, microbes, and other organisms in wild and agricultural systems. The program supports training activities, fellowships, and internships for incoming MS and Ph.D. students, with a goal of fostering interdisciplinarity, diversity, and cross-cutting skill sets as a complement to disciplinary excellence.
