    BRIDGES is an NSF-funded interdisciplinary graduate training program in ecosystem genomics that trains diverse students to communicate (1) across the entire “genes-to-ecosystems” scale, and (2) among the different cultures of science and the people that practice science, to solve real world problems that matter.

    All who are applying to one of UA’s seven graduate programs [(EEB, SPLS, ENVS, BE, HAS, SNRE, EIS)](./#services) for matriculation in fall 2021 are encouraged to apply to join NSF BRIDGES’ first training cohort!   U.S. Citizens and permanent residents are also eligible to apply to competitive NRT fellowships of $34,000 per year for up to two years.  Those not eligible for fellowships are nonetheless encouraged to apply to our program, to avail themselves of the program’s benefits including  interdisciplinary training, travel funding, and opportunities in professional development, and outreach. BRIDGES (and accepting home departments) will work with accepted international students to identify possible paths of funding support.
