      - title: Pablo Arán Sekul (he/him)
        bio: Born and raised in Antofagasta, Chile, I have dedicated all my university and work in the area of Microbiology and Microbial Ecology in extreme environments, specifically in the Atacama Desert, the desert where I grew up. My interest has always been to determine what microorganisms are in a specific environment and how they can survive harsh life conditions (for humans) using molecular and bioinformatics tools. I consider myself a lover of the desert and its secrets. I am an incoming PhD student working in the Saleska and Barberán labs.

      - title: Rebecca Bland (she/her) 
        bio: I am from Durham, North Carolina, but recently finished a Master of Forestry and a Master of Arts in Religion at Yale University. I'll be starting a PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona with Dr. Katrina Dlugosch this fall. I am interested in species invasion and rapid evolution, especially in the context of interspecific interaction. After three years being the "science person" in Divinity School, I also have a heart for science communication, and I enjoy making science understandable to diverse audiences.

      - title: Meara Clark (she/her)
        bio: I graduated from the University of Arizona in 2016 with a degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology. My first job after college was working as a research technician in the Baltrus Lab and my project studied the role of tailocins in microbe-microbe interactions. Currently, I am pursuing a MS in Natural Resources from the School of Natural Resources and the Environment and work with Dr. Laura Meredith studying the effects of drought on soil microbes. My research interests are focused on discovering the genetic mechanisms behind the complex interactions that exist in a microbial community. Then using that information to understand how these interactions fit into the larger picture of an ecosystem.

      - title: Changpeng Fan (he/him) 
        bio: I am an incoming PhD student in the Department of Hydrology and Atmospheric Science at the University of Arizona, advised by Dr. Yang Song. I am interested in climate and land feedback, focusing on the hydrology cycle, microbial-mediated soil carbon, nutrient cycle, and vegetation dynamics.

      - title: Viviana Freire Zapata (she/her)
        bio: I am a Doctoral stuend at the Department of Environmental Sciences at U of A working with Malak Tfaily, PhD. My research interest focuses on understanding the role of biotic and abiotic interactions on ecosystems as a response to disturbance and/or stress. I am interested on the integration of multi-omics data to analyze the underlying processes on ecosystems such as arid soils, thawing permafrost peatlands and agricultural systems.

      - title: Savannah Fuqua (she/her)
        bio: I received an Environmental Biology degree from Washington University in St Louis where I conducted a senior thesis on the role soil microbes play in mediating plant-pollinator interactions. Since graduating, I have worked primarily with Point Reyes National Seashore Association as a vegetation and restoration ecology intern. This fall I will be joining the University of Arizona’s Ecology and Evolutionary Biology PhD program where I will be co-advised by Judith Bronstein and Rachel Gallery. I plan to continue investigating the role that the belowground microbial community plays in shaping the ecology and evolution of aboveground mutualisms.

      - title: Zoe Jensen
        bio: My name is Zoe Jensen (she/her/hers). I am excited to be pursuing a PhD in the Entomology and Insect Sciences GIDP at Uarizona with Dr. Matzkin as my NRT advisor. I received my bachelor’s degree at Cal Poly SLO in agriculture and plant sciences with a minor in biology. I hope to improve agricultural pest management techniques and global food stability through insect science and genetics. My pronouns are she/her.
