      - title: Pablo Arán Sekul (he/him)
        bio: Born and raised in Antofagasta, Chile, I have dedicated all my university and work in the area of Microbiology and Microbial Ecology in extreme environments, specifically in the Atacama Desert, the desert where I grew up. My interest has always been to determine what microorganisms are in a specific environment and how they can survive harsh life conditions (for humans) using molecular and bioinformatics tools. I consider myself a lover of the desert and its secrets. I am an incoming PhD student working in the Saleska and Barberán labs.

      - title: Rebecca Bland (she/her) 
        bio: I am from Durham, North Carolina, but recently finished a Master of Forestry and a Master of Arts in Religion at Yale University. I'll be starting a PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona with Dr. Katrina Dlugosch this fall. I am interested in species invasion and rapid evolution, especially in the context of interspecific interaction. After three years being the "science person" in Divinity School, I also have a heart for science communication, and I enjoy making science understandable to diverse audiences.

      - title: Ghiwa Makke
        bio: My name is Ghiwa Makke (she/her/hers). I have a master’s degree in Molecular Biology with an emphasis on microbial genetics for the Lebanese American University. I have been accepted into the Environmental Science PHD program at the University of Arizona for the Fall 2021 term under the supervision of Dr. Malak Tfaily. I am very interested in research involving the interaction between microorganisms and their environment and its impact on the entire biosphere.

      - title: Jes Szetela
        bio: My name is Jes Szetela (she/her/hers) and I am so excited to be joining UA this fall! I graduated from the University of New England in 2019 with a B.S. in Environmental Science, and have been bouncing around the country in various field tech positions since then. At UArizona, I will be joining the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and the Saleska Lab to pursue a PhD. My research interests are focused on understanding how shifts in vegetative communities impact biogeochemical cycling across scales, specifically in the context of climate change.

      - title: Rebecca Bland
        bio: I'm Rebecca Bland (she/her/hers) from Durham, North Carolina, but am currently finishing up a Master of Forestry and a Master of Arts in Religion at Yale University. I'll be starting a PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at UArizona with Dr. Katrina Dlugosch in the fall. I am interested in species invasion and rapid evolution, especially in the context of interspecific interaction.

      - title: Taylor Portman
        bio: Hello, my name is Taylor Portman (she/ her). I am from Albuquerque, NM, and love all things outdoors! I completed my B.S. in biochemistry at the University of New Mexico where I did a senior research project on the impact of uranium mining legacy on root-associated fungal communities of the native grass Bouteloua gracilis. At the University of Arizona, I am pursuing a Master's in Environmental Science under the mentorship of Dr. Betsy Arnold and Dr. Malak Tfaily. I am interested in how fungi participate in the cycling of nutrients in an ecosystem and how these interactions shape the environment.

      - title: Zoe Jensen
        bio: My name is Zoe Jensen (she/her/hers). I am excited to be pursuing a PhD in the Entomology and Insect Sciences GIDP at Uarizona with Dr. Matzkin as my NRT advisor. I received my bachelor’s degree at Cal Poly SLO in agriculture and plant sciences with a minor in biology. I hope to improve agricultural pest management techniques and global food stability through insect science and genetics. My pronouns are she/her.

      - title: Meara Clark
        bio: I am Meara Clark (she/her/hers). In 2016 I graduated from the University of Arizona with a degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology. My first job after college was working as a research technician in the Baltrus Lab and my project studied the role of tailocins in microbe-microbe interactions. Currently, I am pursuing a MS in Natural Resources from the School of Natural Resources and the Environment and work with Dr. Laura Meredith studying the effects of drought on soil microbes. My research interests are focused on discovering the genetic mechanisms behind the complex interactions that exist in a microbial community. Then using that information to understand how these interactions fit into the larger picture of an ecosystem.

      - title: Changpeng Fan
        bio: My name is Changpeng Fan (he/him/his) and I am a Ph.D. student in the Dept. of Hydrology and Atmospheric Science at the University of Arizona, advised by Dr. Yang Song. I am interested in climate and land feedback, focusing on the hydrology cycle, microbial-mediated soil carbon, nutrient cycle, and vegetation dynamics.
